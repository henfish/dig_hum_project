Don't worry. I'll be a father to you all\nI'll save two of every animal, no matter how small\nBut I'll need some assistants to look after the zoo\nI can't see nobody better. So, you'll just have to do.\"\nI said, \"Just tell me something before it's too late and we're gone\nI mean just how safe is this boat we'll be on?\"\n\n\"It's rock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\"\n\nIt rained for forty days and forty long nights\nI'd never seen rain like it and it looked like our old friend\nWas being proved right\nWe had no time to worry though there was just to much to do\nBetween the signified monkey and the kangaroo\nWe had to wash all the animals we had to feed them too\nWe were merely human slaves in a big floating zoo\nShe said, \"Hey baby I don't mean to be flip\nBut it seems this old man is on some power trip\"\nI said, \"No, no, sugar. You must be wrong\nI mean: look at the size of this boat we're on.\nWe're as safe as houses, as safe as mother's milk\nHe's as cool as November and as smooth as China silk\nHe's God's best friend. He's got a seat on the board\nAnd life may be tough, but we're sailing with the Lord.\"\n\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\n\nWoke up this morning and something had changed\nLike a room in my house had just been rearranged\nShe said, \"It's stopped raining and I know the guy's kind\nBut if we stay here much longer I'm gonna lose my mind.\"\nSo we said we had a mission for his favourite dove\nTo see if there was any mercy from this great God above\nSo to find dry land, away the white bird flew\nWe didn't need no country just a rock would do\nWhen the dove came back to us, he threw down a twig\nIt was manna from heaven and meant we could blow this gig\n\"But the rock's too small,\" he said, \"Can't you see?\"\nI said, \"It's just perfect for her. It's perfect for me.\"\n\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\nGot anymore bright ideas?\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\nRock steady rock steady\n",

Come on!\nDon't leave me lonely, don't leave me sad\nIt'll be the sweetest five minutes you've ever had.\"\n\nDon't judge me\nYou could be me in another life\nIn another set of circumstances\n\nDon't judge me\nOne more night\nI'll just have to take my chances\nAnd tomorrow we'll see\n",

It's what you said on the phone\nI'm just a prisoner of love always hid from the light\nTake me dancing, please take me dancing tonight\n\nI imagine his wife, she don't look nothing like a fool\nShe picks the kids up from some private school\nShe remembers what he told her, he was late and worked alone\nBut there's more than a suspicion in this lingering cologne\nAnd the kids just won't be quiet and she runs a traffic light\nAnd she drives into the night\n\nPlease take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own\nYou promised one day we could it's what you said on the phone\nI'm just a prisoner of love always hid from the light\nTake me dancing, please take me dancing tonight\n\nSo here I am in a stolen car at a traffic light\nThey go from red to green and so I just drive into the night\n\nPlease take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own\nYou promised one day we could it's what you said on the phone\nI'm just a prisoner of love always hid from the light\nTake me dancing, please take me dancing tonight\n",

And why would I agree?\"\nWhen his hand was all that I'd received, as far as I remember\nIt's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness up to then ye see\nI'd a plan of me own and I'd quit this place when I came of age September\n\nThese dead man's boots know their way down the hill\nThey can walk there themselves, and they probably will\nI'd plenty of choices, and plenty other routes\nAnd he'd never see me walking in these dead man's boots\n\nWhat was it made him think I'd be happy ending up like him?\nWhen he'd hardly got two halfpennies left, or a broken pot to piss in\nHe wanted this same thing for me, was that his final wish?\nHe said, \"What the hell are ye gonna do?\"\nI said, \"Anything but this!\"\n\nThese dead man's boots know their way down the hill\nThey can walk there themselves and they most likely will\nBut they won't walk with me 'cos I'm off the other way\nI've had it up to here, I'm gonna have my say\nWhen all ye've got left is that cross on the wall?\nI want nothing from you, I want nothing at all\nNot a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through\nGet this through your head, I'm nothing like you\nI'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more dispute\nAnd ye'll die before ye see me in your dead man's boots\n",

Some boy she loved who fled to sea?\nAnd why waste time debating whether she'd be waiting for the likes of me?\n\nSo ye drift into port with the scum of the seas\nTo the dance halls and the brothels where you took your ease!\nAnd the ship's left the dock but you're half past caring\nAnd ye haven't got a clue whose bed you're sharing\nAnd your head's like a hammer on a bulkhead door\nAnd it feels like somebody might have broken your jaw\nAnd there's bloodstains and glass all over the floor\nAnd ye swear to God ye'll drink no more\nAnd yet, and yet\n\nIn truth, it's too late to find her\nToo late to remind her at some garden gate\nWhere a servant tells me I should wait\nAnd perhaps a door's slammed in my face\nMy head must be in outer space\nAnd yet, and yet\nBefore the sun has set\nBefore the sea\nThere may be something else that's waiting for\nThe likes of me\n\nThis town, this stain on the sunrise\n",

(What do we got?)\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nYou've got nowt. We've got nowt else\n\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nYou've got nowt. We've got nowt else\n\nWhat have ye got, but the singing in the cables?\nOh, what have ye got, but the ringing in your ears?\nAye, what have ye got, but the telling of the fables?\nAnd the memories of the ships, that we've been building donkey's years\n\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nYou've got nowt. We've got nowt else\n\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nYou've got nowt. We've got nowt else\n\nAye, you've got to die of something\nIt's written in your fate\nYe may as well die of a Tuesday\nAnd woe betide you're late\n\nWhat have ye got, all you men what's fit and able?\nWhat have ye got, for the straining in your neck?\nWhat have ye got, when you're laid out on the table?\nAnd the snapping of a cable when the rigging hits the deck?\n\nWhat have ye got, but the loyalty of brothers?\nWhat have ye got, but this union of the dock?\nWhat have ye got, a bacon sandwich from your mother?\nNot a promise of another with the punching of the clock\n\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nYou've got nowt. We've got nowt else\n\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nNow, what do ye got? (What do we got?)\nYou've got nowt. We've got nowt else\n\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nWhat do ye got? (What do we got?)\nYou've got nowt. We've got nowt else\n",

Now that's some kind of joke!\nI'd be laughing me head off and I'd probably choke\nThe spirit's still willing but the rest of me's weak\nNow the bets are all off and the prospects look bleak\nWhen you're laid like a piece of old meat on the slab\nAnd they'll cut and they'll slice, and they'll poke and they'll jab\nAnd they'll grill ye and burn ye, and they'll wish ye good health\nWith their radium, chemo and God knows what else?\n\nWell ye can't fault the science, though the logic is weak\nIs it really an eternal life we should seek?\nThat ship has sailed\nThat ship has sailed\nThat ship has already sailed...So to speak\n\nOur mission is more than a struggle for breath\nFor a few extra rounds in a fight to the death\nWhen our mission is love, and compassion and grace\nIt's not a test of endurance, or a marathon race\nFor love is the sabre, and love is the shield\nLove is the only true power we wield\nAn eternal love is all ye should seek\nThat ship will be ready to sail...So to speak\n\n[Meg:]\nI hear what you're saying 'cause I've heard it before\nBut I'm afraid if I let what is past through my door\nHow long would he stay, a month or a week\nWhen that ship has already sailed, so to speak?\nShould I settle for something that's safe on this Earth?\nWhat would it profit me, what is it worth?\nIf I lose something precious, completely unique?\n\n[Meg & O'Brian:]\nWhen it's only eternity's love we should seek\n\nFor when that ship sails, and the course has been set\nAnd the wind's in the offing and the sails have been let\nAnd the hatches are full, and the hull doesn't leak\nAnd the ship is all ready to sail...So to speak\n\n[O'Brian:]\nI'm tired and fading and losing the light\nAnd I've no way to tell if it's day or it's night\n\n[Meg:]\nFollow your heart, it's the harbour ye seek\n\n[O'Brian:]\nAnd this ship is ready to sail\nThis ship is ready to sail\n\n[Meg & O'Brian:]\nThis ship is ready to sail...So to speak\n",

Was it 1963?\nBut it seems as if sobriety was not the thing for me\nIt was the worst three hours I ever hope to see\n\nSteel in the stockyard\nIron in the soul\nWe'll conjure up a ship\nWhere there used to be a hole\n\nAnd the ship sets sail and the tale gets told\nAnd the only life I've known is in the shipyard\n\nSteel in the stockyard\nIron in the soul\nWe'll get the bastard finished\nOr we'll end up on the dole\n\nAnd we don't know what we'll do\nIf the yard gets sold\nThe only life we've ever known is in the shipyard\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nAre you ready to party?\n\nAnother suburban-family morning\nGrandmother screaming at the wall\nWe have to shout above the din of our Rice Krispies\nWe can't hear anything at all\n\nMother chants her litany of boredom and frustration\nWe know all her suicides are fake\nDaddy only stares into the distance\nThere's only so much more that he can take\n\nMany miles away\nSomething crawls from the slime\nAt the bottom of a dark Scottish lake\n\nAnother industrial ugly morning\nThe factory belches filth into the sky\nHe walks unhindered through the picket lines today\nHe doesn't think to wonder why\n\nThe secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red-light street\nBut all he ever thinks to do is watch\nWhere every single meeting with his so-called superior\nIs a humiliating kick in the crotch\n\nMany miles away\nSomething crawls to the surface\nOf a dark Scottish loch\n\nAnother working day has ended\nOnly the rush-hour hell to face\nPacked like lemmings into shiny metal boxes\nContestants in a suicidal race\n\nDaddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance\nHe knows that something somewhere has to break\nHe sees the family home now looming in his headlights\nThe pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache\n\nWhoa\n\nMany miles away\nThere's a shadow on the door\nOf a cottage on the shore\nOf a dark Scottish lake\n\nMany miles away\nMany miles away\nMany miles away\nMany miles away\nMany miles away\n\nYeah\n",
