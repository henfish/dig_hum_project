Good car to drive after a war\n\nWell, I remember seein' some ad\nSo I turned on my Conelrad\nBut I didn't pay my Con Ed bill\nSo the radio didn't work so well\nTurned on my record player\u00e2\u0080\u0094\nIt was Rock-a-day Johnny singin', \"Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa\nOur Love's A-gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah\"\n\nI was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue\nI needed somebody to talk to\nSo I called up the operator of time\nJust to hear a voice of some kind\n\"When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock\"\nShe said that for over an hour\nAnd I hung up\n\nWell, the doctor interrupted me just about then\nSayin', \"Hey I've been havin' the same old dreams\nBut mine was a little different you see\nI dreamt that the only person left after the war was me\nI didn't see you around\"\n\nWell, now time passed and now it seems\nEverybody's having them dreams\nEverybody sees themselves\nWalkin' around with no one else\nHalf of the people can be part right all of the time\nSome of the people can be all right part of the time\nBut all of the people can't be all right all of the time\nI think Abraham Lincoln said that\n\"I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours\"\nI said that\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nFar between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll\nWe ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing\nAs majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds\nSeeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing\nFlashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight\nFlashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight\nAn' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night\nAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nIn the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched\nWith faces hidden as the walls were tightening\nAs the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain\nDissolved into the bells of the lightning\nTolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake\nTolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsaked\nTolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake\nAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nThrough the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail\nThe sky cracked its poems in naked wonder\nThat the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze\nLeaving only bells of lightning and its thunder\nStriking for the gentle, striking for the kind\nStriking for the guardians and protectors of the mind\nAn' the poet an the painter far behind his rightful time\nAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nIn the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales\nFor the disrobed faceless forms of no position\nTolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts\nAll down in taken-for granted situations\nTolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute\nFor the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute\nFor the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit\nAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nEven though a clouds's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed\nAn' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting\nElectric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones\nCondemned to drift or else be kept from drifting\nTolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail\nFor the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale\nAn' for each unharmfull, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail\nAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nStarry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught\nTrapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended\nAs we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look\nSpellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended\nTolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed\nFor the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse\nAn' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe\nAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n",

Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\nI'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to\nHey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\nIn the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you\n",

Scott Fitzgerald's books\nYou're very well read\nIt's well known\n\nBut something is happening here\nAnd you don't know what it is\nDo you, Mister Jones?\n\nWell, the sword swallower, he comes up to you\nAnd then he kneels\nHe crosses himself\nAnd then he clicks his high heels\nAnd without further notice\nHe asks you how it feels\nAnd he says, \"Here is your throat back\nThanks for the loan\"\n\nAnd you know something is happening\nBut you don't know what it is\nDo you, Mister Jones?\n\nNow you see this one-eyed midget\nShouting the word \"NOW\"\nAnd you say, \"For what reason?\"\nAnd he says, \"How?\"\nAnd you say, \"What does this mean?\"\nAnd he screams back, \"You're a cow\nGive me some milk\nOr else go home\"\n\nAnd you know something's happening\nBut you don't know what it is\nDo you, Mister Jones?\n\nWell, you walk into the room\nLike a camel and then you frown\nYou put your eyes in your pocket\nAnd your nose on the ground\nThere ought to be a law\nAgainst you comin' around\nYou should be made\nTo wear earphones\n\n'Cause something is happening\nAnd you don't know what it is\nDo you, Mister Jones?\n",

S. Eliot\nFighting in the captain's tower\nWhile calypso singers laugh at them\nAnd fishermen hold flowers\nBetween the windows of the sea\nWhere lovely mermaids flow\nAnd nobody has to think too much\nAbout Desolation Row.\n\nYes, I received your letter yesterday\nAbout the time the door knob broke\nWhen you asked me how I was doing\nOr was that some kind of joke?\nAll these people that you mention\nYes, I know them, they're quite lame\nI had to rearrange their faces\nAnd give them all another name\nRight now I can't read too good\nDon't send me no more letters no\nNot unless you mail them\nFrom Desolation Row.\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nWell, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\r\nThey were the best of friends\r\nSo when Frankie Lee needed more money one day\r\nJudas quickly pulled out a roll of tens\r\nAnd placed them on a footstool\r\nJust above the plotted plain\r\nSayin', \"Take your pick, Frankie Boy\r\nMy loss will be your gain\".\n\r\nWell, Frankie Lee, he sat right down\r\nAnd put his fingers to his chin\r\nBut with the cold eyes of Judas on him\r\nHis head began to spin\r\n\"Would ya please not stare at me like that\", he said\r\n\"It's just my foolish pride\r\nBut sometimes a man must be alone\r\nAnd this is no place to hide\".\n\r\nWell, Judas he just winked and said\r\n\"All right, I'll leave you here\r\nBut you'd better hurry up and choose\r\nWhich of those bills you want\r\nBefore they all disappear\"\r\n\"I'm gonna start my pickin' right now\r\nJust tell me where you''ll be\".\n\r\nJudas pointed down the road\r\nAnd said, \"Eternity\"\r\n\"Eternity ?\" said Frankie Lee\r\nWith a voice as cold as ice\r\n\"That's right\", said Judas Priest, \"Eternity\r\nThough you might call it Paradise\"\r\n\"I don't call it anything\"\r\nSaid Frankie Lee with a smile\r\n\"All right\", said Judas Priest\r\n\"I'll see you after a while\".\n\r\nWell, Frankie Lee, he sat back down\r\nFeelin' low and mean\r\nWhen just then a passing stranger\r\nBurst upon the scene\r\nSaying, \"Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler\r\nWhose father is deceased ?\r\nWell, if you are\r\nThere's a fellow callin' you down the road\r\nAnd they say his name is Priest\".\r\n\"Oh yes, he is my friend\"\r\nSaid Frankie Lee in fright\r\n\"I do recall him very well\r\nIn fact, he just left my sight\"\r\nYes, that's the one\", said the stranger\r\nAs quit as a mouse.\r\n\"Well, my message is, he's down the road\r\nStranded in a house\".\n\r\nWell, Frankie Lee he panicked\r\nHe dropped ev'rythimg and ran\r\nUntil he came up to the spot\r\nWhere Judas Priest did stand\r\n\"What kind of a house is this\", he said\r\n\"Where I have come to roam ?\"\r\n\"It's not a house\", said Judas Priest\r\n\"It's not a house, it's a home\".\n\r\nWell, Frankie Lee he trembled\r\nHe soon lost all control\r\nOver ev'rything which he had made\r\nWhile the mission bells did toll\r\nHe just stood there starring\r\nAt that big house as bright as any sun\r\nWith four and twenty windows\r\nAnd a woman's face in ev'ry one.\n\r\nWell, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee\r\nWith a soulful bounding leap\r\nAnd foaming at the mouth\r\nHe began to make his midnight creep\r\nFor sixteen nights and days he raved\r\nBut on the seventeenth he burst\r\nInto the arms of Judas Priest\r\nWhich is where he died of thirst.\n\r\nNo one tried to say a thing\r\nWhen they carried him out in jest\r\nExcept of course, the little neighbor boy\r\nWho carried him to rest\r\nAnd he just walked along alone\r\nWhit his guilt so well concealed\r\nAnd muttered underneath his breath\r\n\"Nothing is revealed\".\r\nWell, the moral of the story\r\nThe moral of the song\r\nIs simply that one should never be\r\nWhere ones does not belong\r\nSo when you see your neighbor carryin' somethin'\r\nHelp him with his load\r\nAnd don't go mistaking Paradise\r\nFor that home across the road.\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nIf you see her say hello she might be in Tangier\nShe left here last early spring, is living there I hear\nSay for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow\nShe might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so\n\nWe had a falling-out, like lovers often will\nAnd to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill\nAnd though our separation, it pierced me to the heart\nShe still lives inside of me, we've never been apart\n\nIf you get close to her, kiss her once for me\nI always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free\nOh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way\nThough the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay\n\nI see a lot of people as I make the rounds\nAnd I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town\nAnd I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off\nEither I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft\n\nSundown, yellow moon, I replay the past\nI know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast\nIf she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find\nTell her she can look me up if she's got the time\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nPistols shots ring out in the bar room night\nEnter Patty Valentine from the upper hall\nShe sees the bartender in a pool of blood\nCries out, \"My God, they killed them all!\"\n\nHere comes the story of the Hurricane\nThe man the authorities came to blame\nFor something that he never done\nPut him in a prison cell but one time he could-a been\nThe champion of the world\n\nThree bodies lying there does Patty see\nAnd another man named Bello moving around mysteriously\n\"I didn't do it\", he says and he throws up his hands\n\"I was only robbing the register. I hope you understand\n\n\"I saw them leaving,\" he says and he stops\n\"One of us had better call up the cops.\"\nAnd so Patty calls the cops\nAnd they arrive on the scene\nWith their red lights flashing\nIn the hot New Jersey night\n\nMeanwhile far away in another part of town\nRubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around\nNumber one contender for the middleweight crown\nHad no idea what kinda shit was about to go down\n\nWhen a cop pulled him over to the side of the road\nJust like the time before and the time before that\nIn Paterson that's just the way things go\nIf you're black you might as well not show up on the street\n'Less you wanna draw the heat\n\nAlfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops\nHim and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around\nHe said, \"I saw two men running out. They looked like middleweights\nThey jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.\"\n\nAnd Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head\nCop said, \"Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead.\"\nSo they took him to the infirmary\nAnd though this man could hardly see\nThey told him he could identify the guilty men\n\nFour in the morning and they haul Rubin in\nThey took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs\nThe wounded man looks up through his one dying eye\nSays, \"Why'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!\"\n\nHere's the story of the Hurricane\nThe man the authorities came to blame\nFor something that he never done\nPut in a prison cell but one time he could-a been the champion of the world\n\nFour months later the ghettos are in flame\nRubin's in South America fighting for his name\nWhile Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game\nAnd the cops are putting the screws to him looking for somebody to blame\n\n\"Remember that murder that you happened in a bar?\nRemember you said you saw the getaway car?\nYou think you'd like to play ball with the law?\nThink it might-a been that fighter that you saw running that night?\nDon't forget that you are white\"\n\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, \"I'm really not sure.\"\nThe cop said, \"A boy like you could use a break\nWe got you for the motel job and we're talking to your friend Bello\nNow you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow\n\nYou'll be doing society a favor\nThat son of a bitch is brave and getting braver\nWe want to put his ass in stir\nWe want to pin this triple murder on him\nHe ain't no Gentleman Jim.\"\n\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch\nBut he never did like to talk about it all that much\n\"It's my work,\" he'd say, \"and I do it for pay\nAnd when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way\n\nUp to some paradise\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\nAnd ride a horse along a trail.\"\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse\nWhere they try to turn a man into a mouse\n\nAll of Rubin's cards were marked in advance\nThe trial was a pig-circus. He never had a chance\nThe judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums\nTo the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum\n\nAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger\nAnd though they could not produce the gun\nThe DA said he was the one who did the deed\nAnd the all-white jury agreed\n\nRubin Carter was falsely tried\nThe crime was murder 'one'. Guess who testified?\nBello and Bradley and they both baldly lied\nAnd the newspapers\u00e2\u0080\u0094they all went along for the ride\n\nHow can the life of such a man\nBe in the palm of some fool's hand?\nTo see him obviously framed\nCouldn't help but make me feel ashamed\nTo live in a land\nWhere justice is a game\n\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\nAre free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell\nAn innocent man in a living hell\n\nYes, that's the story of the Hurricane\nBut it won't be over 'til they clear his name\nAnd give him back the time he's done\nPut in a prison cell but one time he could-a been\nThe champion of the world\n",

The judge says, \"That's exactly what you get\".\n\r\nHe did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzche and Wilhelm Reich\r\nThey threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike\r\nHis closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand\r\nWhat it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.\n\r\nWhen they let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight\r\nBut he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great\r\nHe tried to find the way back into the life he left behind\r\nTo the boss he said, \"I've returned and now I want what's mine\".\n\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nKing of the streets child of clay\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away.\n\r\nIt was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun\r\n\"I'm around too many children\", he'd say, \"they should never know of one\"\r\nYet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe\r\nEmptied out his register, said, \"Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe\".\n\r\nOne day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York\r\nHe could see it coming through the doors as he lifted up his fork\r\nHe pushed the table over to protect his family\r\nThen he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.\n\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nKing of the streets child of clay\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away.\n\r\nSister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep\r\nI heard his best friend Frankie say, \"He ain't dead he's just asleep\"\r\nThen I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave\r\nI guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.\n\r\nThe sun turned cold over President Street and the town of the Brooklyn mourned\r\nThey said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born\r\nAnd someday if God's in heaven overlooking his preserve\r\nI know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.\n\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nKing of the streets child of clay\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away.\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nSixteen years\nSixteen banners united over the field\nWhere the good shepherd grieves\nDesperate men, desperate women divided\nSpreading their wings 'neath falling leaves\n\nFortune calls\nI stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace\nMerchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down\nShe's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born\nOn midsummer's eve near the tower\n\nThe cold-blooded moon\nThe captain waits above the celebration\nSending his thoughts to a beloved maid\nWhose ebony face is beyond communication\nThe captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid\n\nThey shaved her head\nShe was torn between Jupiter and Apollo\nA messenger arrived with a black nightingale\nI seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow\nFollow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil\n\nI stumbled to my feet\nI rode past destruction in the ditches\nWith the stitches still mending beneath a heart-shaped tattoo\nRenegade priests and treacherous young witches\nWere handing out the flowers that I'd given to you\n\nThe palace of mirrors\nWhere dog soldiers are reflected\nThe endless road and the wailing of chimes\nThe empty rooms where her memory is protected\nWhere the angel's voices whisper to the souls of previous times\n\nShe wakes him up\nForty-eight hours later the sun is breaking\nNear broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks\nShe's begging to know what measures he now will be taking\nHe's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks\nGentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes\nI've moved your mountains and marked your cards\nBut Eden is burning either get ready for elimination\nOr else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards\n\nPeace will come\nWith tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire\nBut will offer no reward when her false idols fall\nAnd cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating\nBetween the King and the Queen of Swords\n",

Ain't nobody there would want marry your sister\nFriend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame\nYou look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.\n\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune\nBird fly high by the light of the moon\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.\n\nWell, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy\nThe law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers\nIn the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed\nMichelangelo indeed could've carved out your features\nResting in the fields, far from the turbulent space\nHalf asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.\n\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune\nBird fly high by the light of the moon\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.\n\nWell, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame\nPreacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain \nNightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks\nMolotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain\nFalse-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin\nOnly a matter of time 'til the night comes stepping in.\n\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune\nBird fly high by the light of the moon\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.\n\nIt's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray\nA woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet\nHe'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat\nTake the motherless children off the street\nAnd place them at the feet of a harlot\nOh, Jokerman, you know what he wants\nOh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.\n\nJokerman dance to the nightingale tune\nBird fly high by the light of the moon\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.\n",

He was supposed to feel bad\r\nHe's the neighborhood bully.\n\r\nWell, the chances are against it, and the odds are slim\r\nThat he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him\r\n'Cause there's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back\r\nAnd a licence to kill him is given out to every maniac\r\nHe's the neighborhood bully.\n\r\nWell, he got no allies to really speak of\r\nWhat he gets he must pay for, he don't get it out of love\r\nHe buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied\r\nBut no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side\r\nHe's the neighborhood bully.\n\r\nWell, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace\r\nThey pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease\r\nNow, they wouldn't hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep\r\nThey lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep\r\nHe's the neighborhood bully.\r\nEvery empire that's enslaved him is gone\r\nEgypt and Rome, even the great Babylon\r\nHe's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand\r\nIn bed with nobody, under no one's command\r\nHe's the neighborhood bully.\n\r\nNow his holiest books have been trampled upon\r\nNo contract that he signed was worth that what it was written on\r\nHe took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth\r\nTook sickness and disease and he turned it into health\r\nHe's the neighborhood bully.\n\r\nWhat's anybody indebted to him for ?\r\nNothing, they say. He just likes to cause war\r\nPride and prejudice and superstition indeed\r\nThey wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed\r\nHe's the neighborhood bully.\n\r\nWhat has he done to wear so many scars ?\r\nDoes he change the course of rivers ? Does he pollute the moon and stars ?\r\nNeighborhood bully, standing on the hill\r\nRunning out the clock, time standing still\r\nNeighborhood bully.\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nWell there was this movie I seen one time\nAbout a man riding across the desert and starred Gregory Peck\nHe was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself\nThe town's people wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck\n\nWell the Marshall now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp\nAs the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath\nTurn him loose let him go let him say he outdrew me fair and square\nI want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death\n\nWell I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in\nAnd you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain\nYou know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart\nThe memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train\n\nI can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert\nIn your busted down Ford and your platform heels\nI could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet\nAh, but you were right it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel\n\nWell we drove that car all night 'til we got into San Anton'\nAnd we slept near the Alamo your skin was so tender and soft\nWay down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back\nI would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off\n\nWell we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies\nNow I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul\nBut I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times\nWhen I was your only man\nAnd she don't want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\nBrownsville girl show me all around the world\nBrownsville girl you're my honey love. Well we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo\nWe pulled up where Henry Porter used to live\nHe owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile\nRuby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back. She saw us\nCome rolling up in a trail of dust\nShe said \"Henry ain't here but you can come on in he'll be back in a little while\"\n\nThen she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking of bumming\nA ride back to where she started\nBut she changed the subject every time money came up\nShe said \"Welcome to the land of the living dead\". You could tell she was\nSo broken-hearted\nShe said \"Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt\"\n\n\"How far are you all going ?\" Ruby asked us with a sigh\n\"We're going all the way until the wheels fall off and burn\nUntil the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies\"\nRuby just smiled and said. \"Ah you know some babies never learn\"\n\nSomething about that movie though well I just can't get it out of my head\nBut I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play\nAll I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved\nAnd a lot of them seemed to be looking my way\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\nBrownsville girl show me all around the world\nBrownsville girl you're my honey love\n\nWell they were looking for somebody with a pompadour\nI was crossing the street when shots rang out\nI didn't know whether to duck or to run so I ran\nWe got him cornered in the churchyard? I heard somebody shout\n\nWell you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it it said\n\"A man with no alibi\"\nYou went out on a limb to testify for me you said I was with you\nThen when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears\nIt was the best acting I saw anybody do\n\nNow I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass but sometimes\nYou just find yourself over the line\nOh if there's an original thought out there I could use it right now\nYou know I feel pretty good but that ain't saying much I could feel a whole lot better\nIf you were just here by my side to show me how\nWell I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck\nYeah but you know it's not the one that I had in mind\nHe's got a new one out now I don't even know what it's about\nBut I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\nBrownsville girl show me all around the world\nBrownsville girl you're my honey love\n\nYou know it's funny how things never turn out the way you had them planned\nThe only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name\nWasn't Henry Porter\nAnd you know there was something about you baby that I liked that was always too\nGood for this world\nJust like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind\nIn the French Quarter\n\nStrange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who\nAre most content\nI don't have any regrets they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone\nYou always said people don't do what they believe in they just do what's most\nConvenient then they repent\nAnd I always said. \"Hang on to me baby and let's hope that the roof stays on\"\n\nThere was a movie I seen one time I think I sat through it twice\nI don't remember who I was or where I was bound\nAll I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck he wore a gun and he was shot\nIn the back\nSeems like a long time ago long before the stars were torn down\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\nBrownsville girl show me all around the world\nBrownsville girl you're my honey love\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nThe pale moon rose in its glory\nOut on the Western town\nShe told a sad, sad story\nOf the great ship that went down\n\nIt was the fourteenth day of April\nOver the waves she rode\nSailing into tomorrow\nTo a golden age foretold\n\nThe night was black with starlight\nThe seas were sharp and clear\nMoving through the shadows\nThe promised hour was near\n\nLights were holding steady\nGliding over the foam\nAll the lords and ladies\nHeading for their eternal home\n\nThe chandeliers were swaying\nFrom the balustrades above\nThe orchestra was playing\nSongs of faded love\n\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming\nAs the ballroom dancers twirled\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\nInto the underworld\n\nLeo took his sketchbook\nHe was often so inclined\nHe closed his eyes and painted\nThe scenery in his mind\n\nCupid struck his bosom\nAnd broke it with a snap\nThe closest woman to him\nHe fell into her lap\n\nHe heard a loud commotion\nSomething sounded wrong\nHis inner spirit was saying\nThat he couldn't stand here long\n\nHe staggered to the quarterdeck\nNo time now to sleep\nWater on the quarterdeck\nAlready three foot deep\n\nSmokestack was leaning sideways\nHeavy feet began to pound\nHe walked into the whirlwind\nSky splitting all around\n\nThe ship was going under\nThe universe had opened wide\nThe roll was called up yonder\nThe angels turned aside\n\nLights down in the hallway\nFlickering dim and dull\nDead bodies already floating\nIn the double bottom hull\n\nThe engines then exploded\nPropellers they failed to start\nThe boilers overloaded\nThe ship's bow split apart\n\nPassengers were flying\nBackward, forward, far and fast\nThey mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled\nEach one more weary than the last\n\nThe veil was torn asunder\n'Tween the hours of twelve and one\nNo change, no sudden wonder\nCould undo what had been done\n\nThe watchman lay there dreaming\nAt forty five degrees\nHe dreamed that the Titanic was sinking\nDropping to her knees\n\nWellington he was sleeping\nHis bed began to slide\nHis valiant heart was beating\nHe pushed the tables aside\n\nGlass of shattered crystal\nLay scattered roundabout\nHe strapped on both his pistols\nHow long could he hold out?\n\nHis men and his companions\nWere nowhere to be seen\nIn silence there he waited for\nTime and space to intervene\n\nThe passageway was narrow\nThere was blackness in the air\nHe saw every kind of sorrow\nHeard voices everywhere\n\nAlarm-bells were ringing\nTo hold back the swelling tide\nFriends and lovers clinging\nTo each other side by side\n\nMothers and their daughters\nDescending down the stairs\nJumped into the icy waters\nLove and pity sent their prayers\n\nThe rich man, Mister Astor\nKissed his darling wife\nHe had no way of knowing\nIt'd be the last trip of his life\n\nCalvin, Blake and Wilson\nGambled in the dark\nNot one of them would ever live to\nTell the tale on the disembark\n\nBrother rose up 'gainst brother\nIn every circumstance\nThey fought and slaughtered each other\nIn a deadly dance\n\nThey lowered down the lifeboats\nFrom the sinking wreck\nThere were traitors, there were turncoats\nBroken backs and broken necks\n\nThe bishop left his cabin\nTo help others in need\nTurned his eyes up to the heavens\nSaid, \"The poor are yours to feed\"\n\nDavey the brothel-keeper\nCame out dismissed his girls\nSaw the water getting deeper\nSaw the changing of his world\n\nJim Dandy smiled\nHe never learned to swim\nSaw the little crippled child\nAnd he gave his seat to him\n\nHe saw the starlight shining\nStreaming from the East\nDeath was on the rampage\nBut his heart was now at peace\n\nThey battened down the hatches\nBut the hatches wouldn't hold\nThey drowned upon the staircase\nOf brass and polished gold\n\nLeo said to Cleo\nI think I'm going mad\nBut he'd lost his mind already\nWhatever mind he had\n\nHe tried to block the doorway\nTo save all those from harm\nBlood from an open wound\nPouring down his arm\n\nPetals fell from flowers\n'Til all of them were gone\nIn the long and dreadful hours\nThe wizard's curse played on\n\nThe host was pouring brandy\nHe was going down slow\nHe stayed right to the end and he\nWas the last to go\n\nThere were many, many others\nNameless here forever more\nThey never sailed the ocean\nOr left their homes before\n\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming\nThe damage had been done\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\nAnd he tried to tell someone\n\nThe captain, barely breathing\nKneeling at the wheel\nAbove him and beneath him\nFifty thousand tons of steel\n\nHe looked over at his compass\nAnd he gazed into its face\nNeedle pointing downward\nHe knew he'd lost the race\n\nIn the dark illumination\nHe remembered bygone years\nHe read the Book of Revelation\nAnd he filled his cup with tears\n\nWhen the Reaper's task had ended\nSixteen hundred had gone to rest\nThe good, the bad, the rich, the poor\nThe loveliest and the best\n\nThey waited at the landing\nAnd they tried to understand\nBut there is no understanding\nOn the judgment of God's hand\n\nThe news came over the wires\nAnd struck with deadly force\nLove had lost its fires\nAll things had run their course\n\nThe watchman he lay dreaming\nOf all the things that can be\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\nInto the deep blue sea\n",

Should I fall on my knees?\nIs there light at the end of the tunnel, can you tell me please?\nStand over there by the cypress tree\nWhere the Trojan women and children were sold into slavery\nLong before the first Crusade\nWay back before England or America were made\nStep right into the burning hell\nWhere some of the best-known enemies of mankind dwell\nMr. Freud with his dreams, Mr. Marx with his ax\nSee the raw hide lash rip the skin from their backs\nGot the right spirit, you can feel it you can hear it\nYou've got what they call the immortal spirit\nYou can feel it all night, you can feel it in the morn\nIt creeps in your body, the day you were born\nOne strike of lightning is all that I need\nAnd a blast of electricity that runs at top speed\nShimmy your ribs, I'll stick in the knife\nGonna jump-start my creation to life\nI wanna bring someone to life, turn back the years\nDo it with laughter and do it with tears\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nI'm sittin' on my terrace, lost in the stars\nListening to the sounds of the sad guitars\nBeen thinking it all over and I've thought it all through\nI've made up my mind to give myself to you\n\nI saw the first fall of snow\nI saw the flowers come and go\nI don't think that anyone ever else ever knew\nI've made up my mind to give myself to you\n\nI'm giving myself to you, I am\nFrom Salt Lake City to Birmingham\nFrom East L.A. to San Antone\nI don't think I can bear to live my life alone\n\nMy eye is like a shooting star\nIt looks at nothin' here or there, looks at nothin' near or far\nNo one ever told me, it's just something I knew\nI've made up my mind to give myself to you\n\nIf I had the wings of a snow white dove\nI'd preach the gospel, the gospel of love\nA love so real, a love so true\nI've made up my mind to give myself to you\n\nTake me out traveling, you're a traveling man\nShow me something I don't understand\nI'm not what I was, things aren't what they were\nI'll go far away from home with her\n\nI traveled a long road of despair\nI met no other traveler there\nLot of people gone, lot of people I knew\nI've made up my mind to give myself to you\n\nWell, my heart's like a river, a river that sings\nJust takes me a while to realize things\nI'll see you at sunrise, I'll see you at dawn\nI'll lay down beside you when everyone's gone\n\nI've traveled from the mountains to the sea\nI hope that the gods go easy with me\nI knew you'd say yes, I'm saying it too\nI've made up my mind to give myself to you\n",

Goodbye, Uncle Sam\nFrankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn\nWhat is the truth, and where did it go?\nAsk Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know\n\"Shut your mouth,\" said a wise old owl\nBusiness is business, and it's a murder most foul\n\nTommy, can you hear me? I'm the Acid Queen\nI'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine\nRidin' in the back seat next to my wife\nHeaded straight on in to the afterlife\nI'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap\nHold on, I've been led into some kind of a trap\nWhere we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give\nWe're right down the street, from the street where you live\nThey mutilated his body and they took out his brain\nWhat more could they do? They piled on the pain\nBut his soul was not there where was supposed to be at\nFor the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that\nFreedom, oh freedom, freedom over me\nI hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free\nSend me some lovin', then tell me no lie\nThrow the gun in the gutter and walk on by\nWake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive\nCross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive\nTurn the radio on, don't touch the dials\nParkland Hospital, only six more miles\nYou got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead\nThat magic bullet of yours has gone on my head\nI'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline\nNever shot anyone from in front or behind\nI've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear\nI'm never gonna make it to the new frontier\nZapruder's film I've seen night before\nSeen it thirty-three times, maybe more\nIt's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean\nUgliest thing that you ever have seen\nThey killed him once and they killed him twice\nKilled him like a human sacrifice\nThe day that they killed him, someone said to me, \"Son\nThe age of the Antichrist has just only begun\"\nAir Force One comin' in through the gate\nJohnson sworn in at 2:38\nLet me know when you decide to throw in the towel\nIt is what it is, and it's murder most foul\n\nWhat's new, pussycat? What'd I say?\nI said that soul of a nation been torn away\nAnd it's beginning to go into a slow decay\nAnd that it's thirty-six hours past Judgment Day\nWolfman Jack, he's speaking in tongues\nHe's going on and on at the top of his lungs\nPlay me a song, Mr. Wolfman Jack\nPlay it for me in my long Cadillac\nPlay me that \"Only the Good Die Young\"\nTake me to that place Tom Dooley was hung\nPlay \"St. James Infirmary\" and the Court of King James\nIf you wanna remember, you better write down the names\nPlay Etta James, too, play \"I'd Rather Go Blind\"\nPlay it for the man with the telepathic mind\nPlay John Lee Hooker, play \"Scratch My Back\"\nPlay it for that strip club owner named Jack\nGuitar Slim going down slow\nPlay it for me and for Marilyn Monroe\n\nPlay \"Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\"\nPlay it for the First Lady, she ain't feeling any good\nPlay Don Henley, play Glenn Frey\nTake it to the limit and let it go by\nPlay it for Carl Wilson, too\nLooking far, far away down Gower Avenue\nPlay \"Tragedy\", play \"Twilight Time\"\nTake me back to Tulsa to the scene of the crime\nPlay another one and \"Another One Bites the Dust\"\nPlay \"The Old Rugged Cross\" and \"In God We Trust\"\nRide the pink horse down that long, lonesome road\nStand there and wait for his head to explode\nPlay \"Mystery Train\" for Mr. Mystery\nThe man who fell down dead like a rootless tree\nPlay it for the reverend, play it for the pastor\nPlay it for the dog that got no master\nPlay Oscar Peterson, play Stan Getz\nPlay \"Blue Sky,\" play Dickey Betts\nPlay Art Pepper, Thelonious Monk\nCharlie Parker and all that junk\nAll that junk and \"All That Jazz\"\nPlay something for the Birdman of Alcatraz\nPlay Buster Keaton, play Harold Lloyd\nPlay Bugsy Siegel, play Pretty Boy Floyd\nPlay the numbers, play the odds\nPlay \"Cry Me a River\" for the Lord of the gods\nPlay Number nine, play Number six\nPlay it for Lindsey and Stevie Nicks\nPlay Nat King Cole, play \"Nature Boy\"\nPlay \"Down in the Boondocks\" for Terry Malloy\nPlay \"It Happened One Night\" and \"One Night of Sin\"\nThere's twelve million souls that are listening in\nPlay \"Merchant of Venice\", play \"Merchants of Death\"\nPlay \"Stella by Starlight\" for Lady Macbeth\nDon't worry, Mr. President, help's on the way\nYour brothers are comin', there'll be hell to pay\nBrothers?

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nI crossed the green mountain, I slept by the stream\nHeaven blazin' in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream\nSomething came up out of the sea\nSwept through the land of the rich and the free\n\nI look into the eyes of my merciful friend\nAnd then I ask myself, is this the end?\nMemories linger, sad yet sweet\nAnd I think of the souls in heaven who will meet\n\nAltars are burning with flames falling wide\nThe foe has crossed over from the other side\nThey tip their caps from the top of the hill\nYou can feel them come, more brave blood to spill\n\nAlong the dim Atlantic line\nThe ravaged land lies for miles behind\nThe light's comin' forward and the streets are broad\nAll must yield to the avenging God\n\nThe world is old, the world is gray\nLessons of life can't be learned in a day\nI watch and I wait and I listen while I stand\nTo the music that comes from a far better land\n\nClose the eyes of our Captain, peace may he know\nHis long night is done, the great leader is laid low\nHe was ready to fall, he was quick to defend\nKilled outright he was by his own men\n\nIt's the last day's last hour of the last happy year\nI feel that the unknown world is so near\nPride will vanish and glory will rot\nBut virtue lives and cannot be forgot\n\nThe bells of evening have rung\nThere's blasphemy on every tongue\nLet them say that I walked in fair nature's light\nAnd that I was loyal to truth and to right\n\nServe God and be cheerful, look upward beyond\nBeyond the darkness that masks the surprises of dawn\nIn the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood\nThey never dreamed of surrendering. They fell where they stood\n\nStars fell over Alabama, I saw each star\nYou're walkin' in dreams whoever you are\nChilled are the skies, keen is the frost\nThe ground's froze hard and the morning is lost\n\nA letter to mother came today\nGunshot wound to the breast is what it did say\nBut he'll be better soon he's in a hospital bed\nBut he'll never be better, he's already dead\n\nI'm ten miles outside the city and I'm lifted away\nIn an ancient light that is not of day\nThey were calm, they were blunt, we knew 'em all too well\nWe loved each other more than we ever dared to tell\n",

I really can't say\nSomething about her said \"Trust me anyway\"\nAs the days turned into minutes and the minutes turned back into hours\nPretended to be sleeping, and he thought I was\nBut I was only paying attention like a rattlesnake does\nWhen he's hearing footsteps trampling on the flowers\n\nThe Caribbean winds still blow, from Mexico to Curacao \nFrom Chinatown to the furnace of desire\nAnd them distant ships of liberty on the iron waves so bold and free\nBringing everyone that's near to me closer to the fire\n\nOur shadows grew closer till they touched on the floor\nProdigal sons waiting close to the door\nPreaching obscenities, waiting for the night to arrive\nHe was well connected, but her heart was a snare\nShe had left him to die in there \nBut I knew I couldn't get him out while he still was alive\n\nThe stars on the balcony, flies buzz my head\nCeiling fan's broken, there's heat in my bed\nStreet band playing \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\"\nShe looked into my eyes, I hear them mission bells ring\nShe said \"I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing\n\"You can do about it so you might as well let it be\"\n\nAnd them Caribbean winds still blow, from Mexico down to Curacao\nFrom Chinatown to the furnace of desire\nAnd them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free\nBringing everything you'd ever want close to me closer to the fire\n\nAtlantic city by the cruel sea, I hear a voice crying \"Daddy,\" I always think it's for me\nBut it's only the silence in the Buttermilk Hills that calls\nEvery new messenger bringing evil reports\n'Bout armies that are rioting whose fuses are short\nAnd them ugly gargoyles and hate words written on walls\n\nWould I have married her? I don't know, I suppose\nShe had bells in her braids, fire in her clothes\nBut the curtain was rising, like they say, the show must go on\nAnd I felt you come over me, some kind of gloom\nI was gonna say \"Come on with me, I've got plenty of room\"\nBut I knew I'd be lying, and besides she had already gone\n\nAnd them Caribbean winds still blow, from Curacao to Mexico\nFrom Chinatown to the furnace of desire\nAnd them distant ships of liberty, on iron waves so bold and free\nBringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire\n",
