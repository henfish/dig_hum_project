Can you fly\nLike an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky\n\nI followed with the sideshows to another town\nAnd I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds\nYou were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice\nAnd I thought I saw you cheating once or twice, once or twice\n\nI heard your bid once or twice\nWere you wondering was the gamble worth the price\nPack it in\nI heard you did! Pack it in\nWas it hard to fold a hand you knew could win\n\nSo lately you've been hiding - it was somewhere in the news\nAnd I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues\nAnd a voice calls out the numbers, and it sometimes mentions mine\nAnd I feel like I've been working overtime, overtime\n\nI've lost my fire overtime\nAlways playin' one more hand for one more dime\nSlowin' down I'm gettin' tired!\nSlowin' down\nAnd I envy you the valley that you've found\n'Cause I'm midway down the midway\nSlowin' down, down, down, down\n",

Life is our cause\nWhen I think of your kisses\nMy mind see-saws\nDo you see- do you see-\nDo you see how you hurt me baby?\nSo I hurt you too\nThen we both get so blue\n\nI am on a lonely road and I am traveling\nLooking for the key to set me free\nOh the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling\nIt's the unraveling\nAnd it undoes all the joy that could be\nI wanna have fun, I wanna shine like the sun\nWanna be the one that you wanna see\nI wanna knit you a sweater\nWanna write you a love letter\nWanna make you feel better\nI wanna make you feel free\nHmm, hmm, hmm, hmm,\nWanna make you feel free\nI wanna make you feel free\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nIt fell from midnight skies\nIt drummed on the galvanized\nIn the washroom, women tracked the rain\nUp to the make-up mirror\nLiquid soap and grass\nAnd Jungle Gardenia crash\nOn Pine-Sol and beer \nIt's stifling in here \nI've got to get some air \nI'm going outside to get some air\n\nBack in my hometown\nThey would have cleared the floor\nJust to watch the rain come down!\nThey're such sky oriented people\nGeared to changing weather \nI'm floating off in time\nI'm floating off\nI'm floating off in time\n\nWhen I was three feet tall\nAnd wide eyed open to it all\nWith their tasseled teams they came\nTo McGee's General Store\nAll in their beaded leathers\nI would tie on colored feathers\nAnd I'd beat the drum like war \nI would beat the drum like war\nI'd beat the drum\nI'd beat the drum like war\n\nBut when the church got through\nThey traded their beads for bottles\nSmashed on Railway Avenue\nAnd they cut off their braids\nAnd lost some link with nature\nI'm floating into dreams\nI'm floating off\nI'm floating into my dreams\n\nI dream paprika plains\nVast and bleak and God forsaken\nPaprika plains\nAnd a turquoise river snaking\n\n(Where crows gaze vigilant on wires\nWhere cattle graze the grasses\nFar from the digits of business hours\nThe moon clock wanes and waxes\nBut here all time is stripped away\nNowhere on these plains\nIs a sprout or an egg in evidence\nTo measure loss or gain \nOnly a little Indian band\nCome down from some windy mesa\nNo women to make them food and child\nNo expressions on their faces\nI'm low in a helicopter\nAnd the wind from whirling blades\nFlaps their woven blankets\nAnd flags their raven braids\nHow came they to this emptiness?\nHow came they to this dream?\nHow came I to this view\nFrom a flying machine\nOf earth and air and water\nAnd a band of Indian men\nWithout herds or flocks or crops\nOr families or fires to tend?\nLike a phoenix up from ashes now\nA blanket figure springs\nWith a fist raised up to turquoise skies\nLike liberty\nAnd at the point of vanishing\nWhere the sky and the earth meet\nA bomb blooms\nDeadly mushroom\nWhite\nGold\nHeat\nLike a phoenix up from ashes\nUp from violent mysteries\nAnd growing 'till the giant blast\nIs to it like a golfer's tee\nthere comes a child's beach ball\nAnd memory takes me back\nto the beach to toss it up\nto the garage to get it patched\nA pink and yellow beach ball\nRolling\nGrand\nDetached\nTurning the blues and greens of earth\nFrom space probe photographs\nI float out of the hovercraft\nNaked as infancy\nAnd weightless\nAnd drifting\nHorizontally\nLike a filing to a magnet\nLike the long descent of rain\nI am drawn\nI fall against the ball\nAnd lose paprika plains\nI suckle at my mother's breast\nI embrace my mother earth\nI remember perforated blinds\nOver the crib of my birth\nAnd just as Eve succumbed\nTo reckless curiosity\nI take my sharpest fingernail\nAnd slash the globe to see\nBelow me\nVast Paprika plains\nAnd the snake the river traces\nAnd a little band of Indian men\nWith no expressions on their faces)\n\nThe rain retreats\nLike troops to fall on other fields and streets\nMeanwhile they're sweet talking and name calling\nAnd brawling on the fringes of the floor\nI spot you through the smoke\nWith your eyes on fire\nFrom J&B and coke\nAs I'm coming through the door\nI'm coming back\nI'm coming back for more!\nThe band plugs in again\nYou see that mirrored ball begin to sputter lights\nAnd spin\nDizzy on the dancers\nGeared to changing rhythms\nNo matter what you do\nI'm floating back\nI'm floating back to you!\n",

What have I done to you?\nThat you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true?\n\nOnce I was blessed; I was awaited like the rain\nLike eyes for the blind, like feet for the lame\nKings heard my words, and they sought out my company\nBut now the janitors of Shadowland flick their brooms at me\nOh you tireless watcher! What have I done to you?\nthat you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true?\n\n([Antagonists:] Man is the sire of sorrow)\nI've lost all taste for life\nI'm all complaints\nTell me why do you starve the faithful?\nWhy do you crucify the saints?\nAnd you let the wicked prosper\nYou let their children frisk like deer\nAnd my loves are dead or dying, or they don't come near\n([Antagonists:] We don't despise your chastening\nGod is correcting you)\n\nOh and look who comes to counsel my deep distress\nOh, these pompous physicians\nWhat carelessness!\n([Antagonists:] Oh all this ranting all this wind\nFilling our ears with trash)\nBreathtaking ignorance adding insult to injury!\nThey come blaming and shaming\n([Antagonists:] Evil doer)\nAnd shattering me\n([Antagonists:] This vain man wishes to seem wise\nA man born of asses)\nOh you tireless watcher! What have I done to you?\nThat you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true?\n\n([Antagonists:] We don't despise your chastening)\nAlready on a bed of sighs and screams,\nAnd still you torture me with visions\nYou give me terrifying dreams!\nBetter I was carried from the womb straight to the grave.\nI see the diggers waiting, they're leaning on their spades.\n\n([Antagonists:] Man is the sire of sorrow\nSure as the sparks ascend)\nWhere is hope while you're wondering what went wrong?\nWhy give me light and then this dark without a dawn?\n([Antagonists:] Evil is sweet in your mouth\nHiding under your tongue)\nShow your face!\n([Antagonists:] What a long fall from grace)\nHelp me understand!\nWhat is the reason for your heavy hand?\n([Antagonists:] You're stumbling in shadows\nYou have no name now)\nWas it the sins of my youth?\nWhat have I done to you?\nThat you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true?\n([Antagonists:] Oh your guilt must weigh so greatly)\nEverything I dread and everything I fear come true\n([Antagonists:] Man is the sire of sorrow)\nOh you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true\n",
