I was a scarlet letter\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet.\"\nBut you were everything to me\nI was begging you, \"Please don't go!\"\nAnd I said\n\n\"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\nI'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'\n\nRomeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel\nThis love is difficult but it's real\nDon't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nI got tired of waiting\nWondering if you were ever coming around\nMy faith in you was fading\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town\nAnd I said\n\n\"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone\nI keep waiting for you, but you never come\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think.\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said\n\n\"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone\nI love you, and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story.

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nI walked through the door with you, the air was cold\nBut something 'bout it felt like home somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\n\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\n",

Promise me this\nThat you'll stand by me forever\nBut if, God forbid, fate should step in\nAnd force us into a goodbye\nIf you have children some day\nWhen they point to the pictures\nPlease tell 'em my name\nTell 'em how the crowds went wild\nTell 'em how I hope they shine\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nI had the time of my life with you\n\nLong, long live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nAnd I was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid\nSinging, \"Long live all the mountains we moved\"\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\nAnd long, long live that look on your face\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered\n",

On our last night\n\nOh\nI remember waking up with you\nThe days doin' nothin'\nYou meant more to me then, than you ever knew\nYou were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a Nobel seminar\nHope the the world never tore that out of you\n\nWasn't it you that told me?\nThe sun would always chase the day\nWasn't it you that told me?\n\nAngels fly in the air tonight\nSaying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?\nAnd stars collide in the air so light\nOr was it just like those promises you made on our last night?\n\nTell me whatever happened to the things you loved?\nAnd the songs we played and the Indian days\nWhatever happened to the things you gave away?\nLike Harold and Martin singing\n\nI was waving as you drove away\nThe sunlight was falling\nYou were riding backwards in a dusty window pane\n\nAngels fly in the air tonight\nWas it just like the promises that we made?\nAnd stars collide in the air so light\nWas it just like those promises that you made?\nOn our last night\nOn our last night\nOh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, yeah, oh\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nI heard a song tonight on the radio\nAnother girl sings about a boy\nShe sees his face\nIn every space\nEvery room\n\nAnd I know if I turn around you won't be there\nIf I close my eyes will you be there?\n\nI don't wanna lose your face\nAnd I don't wanna wake up one day\nAnd not remember what time erased\nAnd I don't wanna turn around\n'Cause I'm not scared\nOf what love gave me and took away\nAnd I don't wanna lose your face\n\nI've got a picture of you in my bedroom\nAnd I hope it never falls\nI hope I never lose that feeling\nI used to get when you would call\n\nAnd now I wonder to myself\nWho were you? Where are you?\nWere you ever here at all?\n\nI don't wanna lose your face\nAnd I don't wanna wake up one day\nAnd not remember what time erased\nAnd I don't wanna turn around\n'Cause I'm not scared\nOf what love gave me and took away\nAnd I don't wanna lose your face\n\nThat girl in the song had it so good\nI wish I could close my eyes and see you\nI wish the sky had your face\nAnd the oceans had your eyes\nAnd the sunset had your lips\nAnd I had you\n\nI don't wanna lose your face\nI don't wanna wake up one day\nAnd not remember what time erased\nAnd I don't wanna turn around\n'Cause I'm not scared\nOf what love gave me and took away\nAnd I don't wanna lose your face\n\nI don't wanna lose your face\nI don't wanna turn around\n",
