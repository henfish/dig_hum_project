I'm getting on there, hold it\nThanks a lot\nWow, New York, just like I pictured it\nSkyscrapers and everything\nHey, hey brother, hey come here slick. (Huh?)\nHey you look, you look hip man\nHey, you wanna make yourself five bucks man? (Yeah)\nYou look hip, run this across the street for me right quick\nOkay, run this across the street for me\nWhat? Huh? I didn't know! What?\nGimme your hands up you punk!\nI'm just going across the street\nPut that leg up, shut your mouth\nHell no, what did I do?\nOkay, turn around, turn around\nPut your hands behind your back, let's go, let's go\nA jury of your peers having found you guilty, ten years\nWhat?\nCome on, come on, get in that cell, nigger\nGod, Lord\n\nHis hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty\nHe spends his life walking the streets of New York City\nHe's almost dead from breathing in air pollution\nHe tried to vote but to him there's no solution\nLiving just enough, just enough for the city\n\nI hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow\nAnd that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow\nThis place is cruel, nowhere could be much colder\nIf we don't change, the world will soon be over\nLiving just enough, stop giving just enough for the city\n",

        "lyrics": "\n\r\nSome people ask me why always on the bright side\nWhen there's so much going on down the other side\nIt's like I live in a bubble with no trouble\nAnd problems don't exist\n\nI chuckle and tell them that ain't the case at all\nIt goes way back to the time when I was very small\nNot in mind but size and age my papa use to say\n\nYou can always look at the negative\nBut you should always live in the positive\nSo I try every day to live that way\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nSome people live in what was and what they could have been\nAs opposed to living in a what is and how much they can\nAnd be the first to complain about nothing in life going their way\nThe attitude is \"that I can't do nothing 'bout\" \nAnd very happy with just breathing in and out\nThe ones that when you say, \"Let's go make a difference.\"\nThey'll say \"Naw. That's OK.\"\n\nSo I don't waste time on the trip side\n'Cause I do know the real on the flip side\nAnd I'm crystal clear every day that's why I say, yeah\n\nWhen I see the morning\nAnd the sun is smiling down upon me\nI joy in the blessing\nThat still the ground is not above me\nAnd for the people\nThat I can truly say do love me, I feel \nPositivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be\nPositivity, 'cause this day did not have to be\n\nSome ask me why I'm such an optimist\nWhen it's more fashionable be a pessimist\nFrom what's in seventy-five percent of what we read, hear and view\nWell I use to have a friend named Minnie Riperton\nWho use to always say when she was living\n\"Like fine wine I like seeing the glass of life as half full than half empty\"\n\nI'm saying sometimes life can't be rough\nBut never to the point of me saying I've had enough\nLong as my heart beats I ain't giving up\nThat's why I say every day\n\nWhen people ask me as an African American\nWhat do I see for tomorrow in the human plan?\nIs it possible for all the people of the world to co-exist?\n\nI say unity is only as big as our vision\nAnd if it's narrow, try to expand beyond the horizon\nBut true leaders must guide us through the ills of society\nThat stands in our way\nSo if the road is to harmony, be with the call\nBut if it's about discord, don't take the ride at all\n'Cause the world vision I see is the one-we for everybody\n\nWhen I see the morning\nAnd the sun is smiling down upon me\nJust joy in the blessing\nThat still the ground is not above me\nAnd for the people\nThat you can truly say do love you, do feel\nPositivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be\nPositivity, and that's the energy the world needs\nPositivity, 'cause that's what life means to me\nPositivity, 'cause this day did not have to be\nPositivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be\nPositivity, 'cause that's the energy the world needs\nPositivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be\nPositivity, and this day did not have to be\nPositivity, 'cause that's what life means to me\nPositivity, and that's the energy the world needs\nPositivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be\nPositivity, and that's the energy the world needs\n",
